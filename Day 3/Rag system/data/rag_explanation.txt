        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models
        by incorporating external knowledge retrieval into the generation process. It was introduced
        by researchers at Facebook AI in 2020.
        
        ## Core Components
        
        1. **Document Store**: A collection of documents containing domain-specific knowledge.
        2. **Retriever**: A system that finds relevant documents or passages based on a query.
        3. **Generator**: A language model that produces responses using the retrieved information.
        4. **Embedding Model**: Converts text into vector representations for similarity matching.
        5. **Vector Database**: Efficiently stores and indexes embeddings for quick retrieval.
        
        ## Advantages of RAG
        
        - Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual information
        - Enables access to up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
        - Allows incorporation of domain-specific knowledge
        - Provides transparency through explicit source attribution
        - More cost-effective than continuous model retraining
        
        ## Implementation Approaches
        
        There are several ways to implement RAG systems:
        
        - **Basic RAG**: Simple retrieval followed by generation
        - **Advanced RAG**: Includes query reformulation, multi-step retrieval, and reranking
        - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combines fine-tuning with retrieval for specialized domains
