    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models
    by allowing them to access external knowledge. This approach combines the strengths of 
    retrieval-based and generation-based methods in natural language processing.
    
    The key components of a RAG system include:
    1. A document store containing knowledge
    2. A retrieval system to find relevant information
    3. A language model to generate responses
    
    RAG addresses the limitations of traditional language models, such as outdated knowledge
    and hallucinations, by grounding responses in factual information from external sources.
